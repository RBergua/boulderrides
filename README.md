# Boulder Group Rides

> [!NOTE]
> On June 1, 2026, Strava announced significant changes to its Developer Program and API Terms:
>
> * An active Strava subscription will be required by **June 30, 2026**, to maintain API access.
> * The Club Activities endpoints on the API will be deprecated on **September 1, 2026**. Strava cited low developer adoption as the reason for discontinuing support. However, it is unclear if the Club Events endpoints are impacted.
>
> Meanwhile, Ride with GPS has introduced support for free non-recurring ride events in addition to its paid Club Account offering that includes recurring rides, expanding the options available for group ride organization.
>
> We are monitoring these changes and evaluating their impact on the project.

An interactive map showing **cycling group rides in Boulder, Colorado**.
It aggregates **Strava and Ride with GPS club events** and displays upcoming rides by day. It also lists nearby **races and events** sourced from **BikeReg**.

## Live version
The frontend is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, served directly from the repository.

- **Primary site:** https://boulderrides.cc
- **GitHub Pages:** https://rbergua.github.io/boulderrides/

## Features

- **7-day calendar** — Quickly see which days have scheduled rides; the first day with rides loads automatically
- **Interactive map** — Routes are drawn as color-coded polylines using [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/) with MapTiler vector tiles and an automatic fallback to Stadia Maps
- **Metric/Imperial units** — Bottom-left "Metric" button switches between miles/feet ↔ km/meters; updates tooltips and mobile sheets instantly (imperial by default)
- **Paved vs unpaved surfaces** — Routes are drawn as solid lines on paved surfaces and dashed lines on unpaved surfaces
- **Start pin markers** — A colored pin marks the starting location of each ride
- **Desktop** — Hover over a route or its start pin to highlight it and dim the others to gray, showing the club name, ride title, start time, and whether the ride is women-only; click to open the Strava or Ride with GPS event in a new tab
- **Mobile** — Tap a route or its start pin to see its details in a bottom sheet; tap "View on..." to open the event; swipe the panel down (or tap the map background) to dismiss it and restore all routes
- **Auto-fit bounds** — The map zooms to fit all routes for the selected day
- **Races & Events** — Dedicated page listing upcoming races and events
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — Installable on Android and iOS home screens for a full-screen, app-like experience with custom splash screens for all device sizes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No build tools required — this is a plain HTML/JS app. You just need a local HTTP server.

### Run Locally

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

> **Tip:** Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) forces the browser to re-download all files instead of using cached versions.

> **Tip:** To emulate a mobile device, open browser DevTools (`F12`) and toggle the device toolbar.

## Ride Data Format

Ride data is automatically fetched from the Strava and Ride with GPS API by a backend process that runs twice a day (12 PM & 1 AM) and keeps `club_rides.json` in the `data` branch up to date. Each entry in the array represents one ride:

```json
[
  {
    "source": "Strava",
    "club_id": 575042,
    "club_name": "Rapha Boulder",
    "title": "Social Ride",
    "date": "2026-03-08 10:00",
    "url": "https://example.com/ride",
    "starting_location": [
      40.016888,
      -105.285529
    ],
    "women_only": false,
    "route_id": 3471700207861648642,
    "distance": 24.8,
    "elevation_gain": 1247,
    "route": [
      [
        40.01962,
        -105.27153,
        "paved"
      ],
      [
        40.0195,
        -105.27212,
        "unpaved"
      ],
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | string | Data source: `"Strava"`, `"Ride with GPS"`, or `"Site"` |
| `club_id` | number | Strava or Ride with GPS club ID; `null` if unavailable |
| `club_name` | string | Name of the organizing club |
| `title` | string | Ride name |
| `date` | string | `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"` in 24-hour format; displayed as 12-hour (AM/PM) in the frontend |
| `url` | string | Link to the Strava or Ride with GPS ride event |
| `starting_location` | `[lat, lng]` | Start marker position (optional; if not available, it uses the first point in `route`) |
| `women_only` | boolean | If `true`, indicates the event is women-only. Since Ride with GPS does not support this flag, the value defaults to `false`. |
| `route_id` | number | Strava or Ride with GPS route ID |
| `distance` | number | Route distance in miles (1 decimal); `null` if unavailable |
| `elevation_gain` | number | Total elevation gain in feet (integer); `null` if unavailable |
| `route` | `[[lat, lng, surface], ...]` | Array of latitude and longitude coordinates defining the route; each point includes a surface tag (`"paved"` or `"unpaved"`), or `null` if the OpenStreetMap surface classification failed |

## Race and Events Data Format

Race and event data is stored in `races.json` in the `data` branch. Data is refreshed weekly from the BikeReg API (Mondays at 3 AM). Some major events not listed on BikeReg (e.g., Triple Bypass, Mt. Blue Sky Hill Climb, Tuesday Night Thunder) are hardcoded in the backend. Each entry in the array represents one race or event:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Koppenberg Road Race",
    "url": "http://www.withoutlimits.co",
    "reg_link": "http://www.BikeReg.com/73713",
    "location": "Superior",
    "latitude": 39.9527634,
    "longitude": -105.1685977,
    "type": ["Road Race", "American Cycling Association"],
    "date": "2026-05-03"
  },
  {
    "name": "Superville Stage Race",
    "url": "http://www.withoutlimits.co",
    "reg_link": "http://www.BikeReg.com/74224",
    "location": "Superior",
    "latitude": 39.9083424,
    "longitude": -105.1699298,
    "type": ["Road Race"],
    "date": ["2026-05-16", "2026-05-17"]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Display name of the race or event |
| `url` | string | Event website URL |
| `reg_link` | string | Registration link (typically a BikeReg URL) |
| `location` | string | City or town where the event takes place |
| `latitude` | number | Latitude of the event location |
| `longitude` | number | Longitude of the event location |
| `type` | array of strings | One or more event type tags (e.g. `"Road Race"`, `"Criterium"`, `"Time Trial"`, `"Mountain Bike"`, `"Special Event"`) and/or sanctioning body (e.g. `"American Cycling Association"`, `"Colorado Bicycle Racing Association (CBRA)"`) |
| `date` | string or array of strings | Event date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format; use a plain string for single-day events, or an array of strings for multi-day events (e.g. a stage race) |

## Weather Data Format

Weather data is stored in `weather.json` in the `data` branch. Data is fetched daily from the National Weather Service at 5 AM and 11 AM and corresponds to downtown Boulder. Each entry in the array represents one day:

```json
{
  "2026-06-30": [
    {
      "time": "9 AM",
      "temperature_F": 70,
      "description": "Sunny",
      "symbol": "☀️"
    },
    {
      "time": "4 PM",
      "temperature_F": 87,
      "description": "Slight Chance Showers And Thunderstorms",
      "symbol": "🌩️"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| (key) | string | Forecast date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| `time` | string | Forecast time, (Daylight Savings Time (summer): `"9 AM"` and `"4 PM"`, Standard Time (winter): `"10 AM"` and `"2 PM"`) |
| `temperature_F` | number | Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (converted to Celsius in the frontend when Metric is selected) |
| `description` | string | Short text description of conditions (e.g. `"Sunny"`, `"Mostly Sunny"`, `"Chance Showers And Thunderstorms"`) |
| `symbol` | string | Emoji representing the forecast (e.g. `"☀️"`, `"🌤️"`, `"🌩️"`) |

## Using the Data

The ride and race data is publicly available and you are welcome to use it in your own projects under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE).

**Ride data** (updated twice daily at 12 PM & 1 AM):
[`club_rides.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RBergua/boulderrides/data/club_rides.json)

**Race and event data** (updated weekly on Mondays at 3 AM):
[`races.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RBergua/boulderrides/data/races.json)

The data schemas are documented in the sections above. If you build something with this data, a link back to [boulderrides.cc](https://boulderrides.cc) is appreciated. For questions or to let us know what you built, reach out at [team@boulderrides.cc](mailto:team@boulderrides.cc).

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html        # Main app (map + calendar)
├── club_rides.json   # Ride data, auto-updated by the backend process (Strava and Ride with GPS API). The file is only committed when its contents change
├── races.json        # Race and event data, auto-updated by the backend process (BikeReg API). Major events not on BikeReg are hardcoded
└── weather.json      # Weather data, auto-updated by the backend process (National Weather Service API)
```

## Customization

- **Days shown** — Change the `7` in `generateCalendar()` to show more or fewer days. Note that a longer window of time could be misleading. Recurring weekly rides on Strava only appear once their previous occurrence has passed, so looking further ahead would result in missing entries
- **Default map center** — Update `defaultCenter` in `index.html` (currently set to downtown Boulder)
- **Default zoom** — Update `defaultZoom` (currently `12`)
- **Route colors** — Edit the `colors` palette array in `index.html` to change the cycle of colors assigned to routes
- **Map tiles** — The app loads MapTiler (outdoor/terrain) as the primary tile source. If MapTiler fails (e.g., quota exceeded or not available), it silently falls back to Stadia Maps. The MapTiler API key is locked to requests from `boulderrides.cc`


## Built With

- [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/) — Interactive maps with vector tile rendering
- [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) — Outdoor/terrain map tiles (primary)
- [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/) — Outdoor/terrain vector map tiles (fallback if MapTiler is not available). Free, no API key required
- [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) — Extends MapTiler tile cache from the default 8 hours to 120 days, saving API requests and making the map load faster for returning visitors (tiles served from disk instead of the network)
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) — Road surface data source used for paved/unpaved classification, queried via the [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/) by the backend
- [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) — Source of group ride data, fetched by the backend
- [Ride with GPS API](https://ridewithgps.com/api) — Source of group ride data, fetched by the backend
- [BikeReg API](https://www.bikereg.com/) — Source of race and event data, fetched by the backend
- [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) — Weather forecasts, fetched by the backend
- [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) — Privacy-friendly analytics
